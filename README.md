# ZType
Beat the game by typing out words displayed on the screen. Earn points and advance through levels as you improve your typing skills.
Instructions to play our game: 

	1. The game will automatically start when you run “ExamplesZWorld” in the run configurations.
	2. Words will start to come down from the top, and as they flow down, type out (IN LOWERCASE) 
	     the letters that appear on the screen. 
	3. If the user types a letter that one of the words begin with, the word will turn green to  demonstrate 
	     which they have started to type.
	4. Once the player’s score surpasses a multiple of 10, their level will increase, meaning the words
               will begin to fall faster, and the number of points gained per word will increase by 2 
	5. If a word reaches the bottom of the screen (where the pink circle is), the “Game Over” screen will appear.

Notes:

	•	The player’s score and level can be found in the bottom left and right, respectively, of the screen 
	•	The level that the player is on will be in the middle of the screen until the first word of the next level is completed
